what I did in December:
- Got more coffee nerd gear, including a [kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-ekg-electric-pour-over-kettle?variant=18635551080563) (to replace the one that was going to burn my house down) and an [electric grinder](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder) (how do I stop it from covering my entire kitchen with grounds every time I use it?)
- 1 year of coffee!

- Started using [Garmin Forerunner 45S](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/682416/pn/010-02156-02) to track various stats, which is very fun
- Wrote a review of my [Olympus film camera](olympus.html) that mentioned that I thought the moving components on the camera could break, and then immediately (a couple days later) dropped the camera and the sliding lid broke off :(
- Made my yearly Christmas block print (for printing handmade cards and decorating wrapping)!

- Went to Boston and visited the ICA and MFA museums (including the [Yayoi Kusama exhibit](https://www.icaboston.org/art/yayoi-kusama/love-calling) at the ICA)

- Trying out [Arc](https://www.bigpaua.com/arcapp/) -- lots of tracking but the fact that they claim to only store data locally on the phone itself makes it ok. I like to keep track of where I go and used [FindPenguins](https://findpenguins.com/?hl=en) on my recent longer trip to Europe with good results, though not sure what their data practices are like. Arc was found via [Jeremy Maluf](https://jeremymaluf.com/walking/). (Update: Arc drained my battery and often lost the location signal for some reason, so I had trouble getting it to work consistently enough to get good data. Also, it's supposed to "learn" but it had trouble being "smart" over the couple of weeks I used it (often thought I was a bike, had trouble determining what a location was, etc).)
- [1mb club](https://1mb.club/about), [512kb club](https://www.512kb.club/), [250kb club](https://250kb.club/) - Always fun to find out that not only are there people who like the same stuff as you but to also be able to look at what they've made!
