- [This Page is Designed to Last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- [Don't Make a Blog, Make a Brain Dump](https://bt.ht/dump/) and other stuff on [https://bt.ht/](Bradley Taunt's blog)
- Trying out [Arc](https://www.bigpaua.com/arcapp/) -- whew, a lot of tracking -- the fact that they claim to only store data locally on the phone itself makes it palatable. I like to keep track of where I go and used [FindPenguins](https://findpenguins.com/?hl=en) on my recent longer trip to Europe with good results, though not sure what their data practices are like. Arc was found via [Jeremy Maluf](https://jeremymaluf.com/walking/)
