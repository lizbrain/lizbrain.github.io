title: introduction and plans for this website

i finally updated my personal website (you're lookin' at it). i've been looking for an alternative for portfolio websites/social media/blogging platforms for some time and a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [riggraz](https://github.com/riggraz)'s very good [low-CSS Jekyll theme](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) is nearly perfect. my plans for this website are lofty and unspecified, and include:
- some information about myself, since that seems necessary
- various information, probably in list form, about things that i find useful or interesting
- a weekly newsletter blog post compiling my personal notes of things i was thinking about that week (probably comprehensible only to myself)
- travel blog posts whenever i go somewhere (because i like going places)

thanks for reading!
