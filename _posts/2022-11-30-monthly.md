- visited two new climbing gyms: [Volta](https://voltaclimbing.com/) and [Salt Pump](https://www.saltpumpclimbing.com/)!
- shot a lot of film

misc:
- found out that [picasa](https://picasa.en.softonic.com/) is still available for windows 10! my favorite image viewer of all time
- some flaws with this, but an interesting idea: [PasswordCard](https://www.passwordcard.org/en)
- i've been enjoying [Tabby Cat](https://tabbycats.club/) firefox extension, super cute
- [useless machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useless_machine)
- re: august monthly, websites with a very specific but useful purpose, here's another: [When Can I Reuse This Calendar](https://www.whencanireusethiscalendar.com/)
- [Row House in Sumiyoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_House_in_Sumiyoshi) - really intrigued that in this design you need to walk outside to get from one part of the house to another
- since i am a lover of obscure organizational systems: [Calendex](https://thecalendex.com/get_started/)
