updated as i try more italians

1. [amato's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3654737452) - nearly perfect
2. [anania's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/454427791#map=19/43.65768/-70.28996) - like amato's but worse, but still pretty good
3. [monte's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7170757945) - third only because it's expensive, and not technically a classic italian
4. [quality shop](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/288931972)
5. [punky's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/519782721)
6. [corsetti's](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4412475547) - not a fan!!
