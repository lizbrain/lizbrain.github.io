*"casual" because I have no idea what I'm talking about :)

Preface: shot a little bit of film in past lives but recently went down a rabbit hole about the point-and-shoot craze and thought, "me too!!!". I bought an Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 ([full specs here](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/301386/Olympus-Epic-Zoom-80-Cf.html#manual)) as part of a film camera lot that I bid on (and won) in the wee hours of the night. 

I took the Olympus with me to some of the same locations as the Canon EOS Rebel G, so a lot of the review is influenced by their comparison. imo, the Olympus outperformed the SLR (the review of which is also coming)! It's hard to believe that this level of photo comes from something with such a tiny form factor. The only negative I could see with this camera is the excess of dynamic components (the sliding lens cover, which is also the 'on' switch, and the zoom lens). I can see why the fixed-lens version of the Olympus would be more sought after.

Some of my favorite photos:
